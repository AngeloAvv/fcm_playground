## Getting Started
Download the latest binaries under the release section according to your Operative System. Firebase Cloud Messaging Playground is compatible with Windows, Linux and macOS.

To import a project, you need to download a Service Account credentials file from the Firebase Console. You can do this by going to your project settings, selecting the "Service accounts" tab, and clicking on "Generate new private key". This will download a JSON file that contains your service account credentials.
You can then import this file into the app by clicking on the "Import Project" button in the app's main screen. This will allow you to use the app to send notifications to your Firebase project.
Imported projects are saved locally, so you don't need to import them every time you open the app.

## Features
- Send notifications to specific devices using their registration tokens
- Send notifications to a broad audience using topics
- Send custom data payloads
- Light and dark mode support
